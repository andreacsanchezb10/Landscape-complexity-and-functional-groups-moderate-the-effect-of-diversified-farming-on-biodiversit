We present a global dataset documenting outcomes of diversified versus simplified farming practices for biodiversity outcomes (richness and abundance) compiled through a systematic review of primary studies. 

The R script is meant for use to fit meta-analytical models, perform meta-regression analysis, perform Multivariate meta-regression analysis, perform publication bias analysis, and perform sensitivity analysis, 

The original data extracted from primary studies is available on request to the Curator. The dataset is available from Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ENHYWL
