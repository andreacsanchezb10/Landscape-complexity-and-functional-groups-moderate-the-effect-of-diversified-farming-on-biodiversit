We present a global dataset documenting outcomes of diversified versus simplified farming practices for financial outcomes and agronomic yields compiled through a systematic review of primary studies. The dataset includes 3192 comparisons of financial outcomes from 119 articles, and 2086 comparisons of yield outcomes from 82 articles. It contains evidence from 39 countries of effects on five financial metrics (benefit-cost ratio, net income, gross margin, gross income and total costs) of diversifying farms producing annual or perennial crops across 13 FAO commodity groups. Data collection and reporting follows best standards for systematic reviews and is specifically designed for use in meta-analysis. The dataset can also be used a resource for researchers and practitioners to easily access information on where diversified farms effectively contribute to biodiversity and food production outcomes.

The R script is meant for use to fit meta-analytical models, perform meta-regression analysis, perform Multivariate meta-regression analysis, perform publication bias analysis, and perform sensitivity analysis, 

The original data extracted from primary studies is available on request to the Curator. The dataset is available from Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ENHYWL
